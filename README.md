# RealtimeTimetable
Realtime Timetable helps you keep track of your day during online classes. 

The program is a small window designed to sit at the corner of your screen during online classes, and display useful information such as:
Time until the next period, the next break and the end of the day.
Information on next, previous and current period.
Progress through the day

It notifies you about the start of a new period with beeps and the end of the day with 2 beeps

NOTE:
you must install the modules from the requirements.txt file for the program to run.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Beeps work only on windows machines
